# laravel-skeleton

This repository serves as a starting repository for Laravel applications. All cross cutting concerns live here to simplify updating and sharing between different projects.

## How to use

This repository serves as a starting point to a modular approach to app development according to Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture principles. To get started:

1. Create your package directory and run `git init`;
1. Add package remote `git remote add origin <REPOSITORY> (i.e.git@github.com:99linesofcode/.git`);
1. Add the skeleton as a secondary remote `git remote add skeleton git@github.com:99linesofcode/laravel-skeleton.git`;
1. Update local repository using `git fetch skeleton`;
1. Commit changes to the package repository `git rebase skeleton/main`.

If you have access to the Nix package manager you can initialize a local development environment like so:

1. Initialize the `devshell` submodule that is included by default using `git submodule update --init --recursive`;
1. Run `echo use flake ./devshell >> .envrc`;
1. Run `direnv allow`.
